Overview
---
### Explore
When you import a module in Math Inspector, it automatically imports all submodules at the same time and provides a file explorer style interface, enabling anyone to be able to see everything numpy, scipy, and sage are capable of at a glance.

### Learn
Whatever object you are interacting with in Math Inspector, you can always learn more by reading the documentation in the doc viewer, which has been designed to make finding and interacting with the extensive documentation of numpy, scipy, and sage as easily as possible.  See a code example in the doc string you want to run?  Just click on it and see what happens.

### Play
The Math Inspector workspace is a visual block coding environment for interacting with all types of objects and functions by connecting wires to widets and adjusting parameter values. See a function in the module explorer that you want to learn more about?  All you have to do is drag and drop it into the workspace.

### Share
Math Inspector makes it easy to save your project and share it with others, and has been designed in particular to supplement mathematics education youtube video's by providing a free tool for content creators to create animations and share projects for viewers to explore and play with after they are done watching the video, reinforcing whatever concepts have been taught and to make it easy to learn more.
