How to use the doc browser
---
In the left hand side panel you will find a directory of all available
documentation for the object you are currently viewing.  In this case, you
are viewing the documentation for the python module `doc.manual`, which is
part of the math inspector source code.

Most modules and classes in python come with a lot of documentation for all
their functionality.  When you select an object from the side panel, the doc
browser will display the documentation for that object.  If you select a
class or module, the side panel will also be updated with a directory of the
contents of that class or module.  To return to a previous document, click
the name of the previous object in the top navigation area.

To see how it works, try clicking on the class GettingStarted in the side
panel, and use the top navigation area to return to this document.

Running code samples
---
If you see a code sample in a document you want to run, simply click on the
code block and it will be executed by the interpreter.  Try it out!

>>> import numpy as np

Many of the code samples assume that you have already imported the numpy
package with the alias "np", as shown in the command above.  Numpy is the
fundamental package for scientific computing with python, and math inspector
is designed to be a graphical interface for interacting with the numpy
family of python modules. You can learn more about numpy at https://numpy.org

The module tree
---
If you ran the previous code example, then the module `np` should now be
displayed in the left hand side panel of the main window.  Each time a new
module is imported, the directory of it's contents will appear in the
sidebar.

Math inspector comes with numpy and scipy pre-installed, as well as a number
of other modules which can be imported in a similar manner.  Any python
module on your system can be imported as long as it's compatible with python
version 3.9.1

The node editor
---
The node editor is a block coding environment, and it's one of the main
features of math inspector. To display the node editor, select
View > Show Node Editor from the main menu.  It's possible to drag and
drop objects, functions, and classes into the node editor directly
from the module tree.

In what follows we will use the numpy function `linspace` as an example.
From the sidebar in the main window, expand the functions folder in the
`np` module, find the function named `linspace`, and drag it into the
node editor.

An alternative way to create a `linspace` object is by using the following
command

>>> from numpy import linspace

Right clicking on items in the node editor will bring up a menu of the
available options. If you right click on the `linspace` item, you will
have various options, including "show kwargs", kwargs stands for "key
word arguments", and these are optional parameters which can be passed
to a function.

The `linspace` function outputs an array of evenly spaced numbers. The
required arguments are `start` and `stop`, and it has an optional
keyword argument `num`, which determines the size of the array. If you
would like to learn more about linspace before continuing, right click
on the item and choose View Doc.

Displaying Plots
---
If you checked out the documentation for linspace, you may have noticed
at the end there was a code example which used matplotlib to display a
plot of the output.  Math inspector's plotting library updates and
modernize the functionality available in matplotlib, and was designed
to be a replacement for matplotlib.

To plot 25 evenly spaced real numbers between -10 and 10, use the command

>>> plot(linspace(-10, 10, num=25))

To pan the camera, hold down the right mouse button and move the cursor.
You can also use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

Every time you update an object which is being plotted, the changes
will be reflected in the plot window. Try changing the `start` argument
to the linspace item by clicking on the argument value in the node
editor.  This will bring up the text entry widget which you can use to
type in a new value.  It's also possible to change the value of an
argument by hovering the mouse cursor over the vaule, holding down the
left mouse button, and then dragging the cursor around.

See the modules `plot` and `animation` for more information.

Using the examples
---
Math inspector comes with a number of examples to demonstrate some of
the available functionality.  Let's import the examples module, and
view the 3D plot for the cylinder example

>>> from mathinspector import examples
>>> cylinder = examples.cylinder
>>> plot(cylinder())

You can find more information about the available examples from the
documentation, each one has a detailed explaination and multiple code 
samples.

See the module `examples` for more information.

Further Documentation
---
Math inspector provides a number of views for interacting with the
running program. In the left hand side panel are links to the core
modules which constitute the math inspector source code.  These 
links contain documentation detailing the available features, and 
an overview about how the code works.

from .. import console, plot, node, objects, modules, examples, animation, project

class GettingStarted:
	"""To learn about the various features provided by math inspector, lets
	create a simple program directly in the interpreter.  Click this code
	block to create a variable `x` in memory with a value of 1

	>>> x=1

	Math inspector provides a visual represenation of the variables in the
	local namespace in the form of a block coding environment, called the
	node editor.  The node editor makes it possible to experiment and
	interact with otherwise complex programs without needing to write any
	code, or even know much about python at all.

	Item's in the node editor can be dragged by hovering the cursor over an
	item, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging.  Holding down
	the right mouse button in an empty part of the node editor and moving
	the cursor pans all the items, and the scroll wheel is used for zooming
	in and out.

	Let's define a function `f(x)` which returns `x` + 1

	>>> def f(x):
	... 	return x + 1

	When you call a function from the interpreter, the value of it's
	arguments are updated in the node editor, as you can see by calling
	`f(1)`.

	>>> f(1)
	2

	Let's now create a new variable `y` and assign it the value `f(x)`,
	using the variable `x` we previously created

	>>> y = f(x)
	>>> y
	2

	The wires between `x` and `f` should now be connected in the node editor,
	reflecting the code we just executed.

	Binary Operators
	---
	A binary operator is an operator like `+`,`-`,`*`,`/` which acts on the
	objects on it's left and right hand sides.  To illustrate this, lets
	create two new variables `a`,`b` and set them both equal to 1

	>>> a = b = 1

	When using a binary operator in a function call, a new object will
	appear in the node editor representing the operator, and the wires
	will be connected.

	>>> z = f(x+c)

	You can find a full list of python's binary operators by right clicking
	in an empty part of the node editor to bring up the Add Objects menu.
